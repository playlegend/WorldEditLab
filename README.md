<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

WorldEditLab serves as a replacement for the old but very outdated web panel for WorldEdit. Schematics and heightmaps can be uploaded via WorldEditLab. These can then be used in-game.
WorldEditLab combines ease of use with important features like SAML2 and permission management.
Heightmaps and schematics can be sorted and tagged with different tags. Schematics can also be published through different access levels.

### Built With

WorldEditLab was built on well maintained packages:

* [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
* [Passport](https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport)
* [SQLite3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlite3)
* [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize)
* [Embedded JavaScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To use WorldEditLab itself you only need to start a docker container.
Of course, more complex setups can also be built in Kubernetes or similar environments.
A helmet chart is currently still in the works.

### Usage with docker-compose

Here is an example using docker-compose.yml:

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  wel:
    image: playlegend/worldeditlab
    volumes:
      - /opt/world-edit-lab:/usr/src/app/data
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - COOKIE_SECRET="your_session_secret"
      - BASE_URL="http://foobar.com:8080"     
 ```

To make WorldEditLab compatible with FastAsyncWorldEdit, please add the following environments: 
````yaml
    environment:
      - FAWE_UPLOAD_ACCESS=::ffff:127.0.0.1 # IP Whitelist (separated through ',')
      - FAWE_USER_ID=1 # Owner of all uploaded content
````
